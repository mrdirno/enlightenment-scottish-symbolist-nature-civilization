## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern geologist's seismic survey causes a localized, inexplicable weather phenomenon that only an old crofter can interpret.
- Create a journal entry from Alistair Thorne's perspective after his first night in the glen, where the sounds of the forest begin to form intelligible, threatening patterns.
- Draft a myth from Iain's tradition explaining why a specific moss grows only on north-facing stones, and what secret it keeps.
- Write a dialogue where a university board debates the 'acquisition' of the Cailleach's Stone, treating its living symbolism as a mere data set to be owned.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a conceptual 'Symbolist Engine'—a set of rules or a small program that generates natural descriptions where landscape features metaphorically react to human intrusion.
- Create a speculative data schema for 'Thorne's Archive,' attempting to digitally categorize the glen's living symbols, complete with fields that would inevitably fail to capture the truth.
